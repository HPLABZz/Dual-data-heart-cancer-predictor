Dual-Data Heart–Cancer Predictor

A machine learning project that uses dual data sources — genomic data and lifestyle data — to predict the risk of Heart Disease and Cancer. This project combines multimodal feature engineering, data preprocessing, and ML classification into a single precision-health pipeline.

🚀 Features

📊 Dual-Data Input: Uses genomic variants + lifestyle metrics.

🧬 Genomic Feature Extraction: Mutation mapping, and gene-level scoring.

🧠 Machine Learning Models: Random Forest classifier

🎯 Predicts Two Diseases: Heart Disease and Cancer.

🔍 Risk-Level Indicators: Low / Medium / High.

🤖 AI Lifestyle Recommendations based on prediction.

🌐 Web Interface (Flask + HTML/CSS).
